\maketitle

The lecture is based on the textbook \emph{A. Nerode, R. Shore: Logic for Applications}~\cite{nerode_logic_2012}, with some parts taken from the book \emph{M. Ben-ari: Mathematical Logic for Computer Science}~\cite{ben-ari_mathematical_2012}. The course structure and the majority of the content are borrowed from the lectures of Petr Gregor from previous years~\cite{gregor_vyrokova_nodate}; see also the lecture notes by Martin Pilát~\cite{pilat_lecture_nodate}. This version was translated from the original Czech version with the assistance of an LLM-based translator. If you find any typos or other errors, or if there are any parts that are difficult to understand, please let me know.
